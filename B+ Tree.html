    <h1><strong>B+ Tree</strong></h1>
    <p>B+ Tree is an extension of B Tree which allows efficient insertion, deletion and search operations.</p>
    <p>In B Tree, Keys and records both can be stored in the internal as well as leaf nodes. Whereas, in B+ tree, records (data) can only be stored on the leaf nodes while internal nodes can only store the key values.</p>
    <p>The leaf nodes of a B+ tree are linked together in the form of a singly linked lists to make the search queries more efficient.</p>

    <h2>Advantages Of B+ Tree</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Records can be fetched in equal number of disk accesses.</li>
        <li>Height of the tree remains balanced and less as compare to B tree.</li>
        <li>We can access the data stored in a B+ tree sequentially as well as directly.</li>
        <li>Keys are used for indexing.</li>
        <li>Faster search queries as the data is stored only on the leaf nodes.</li>
    </ol>
